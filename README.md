# C-Project-Shopping-Program-
This is my C shopping project which I made myself during 2nd semester of my Bachelor from the knowledge of linked lists <br />
This Project Contains 3 Files <br />
First is c code file <br />
Second is list of items <br />
Third is test file which stores the information of a user which just finished the shopping <br />
Project contains three Structures for user id, for product fetching from txt file, for ekart. <br />
This Project contains features:-
To shop for list of items
To view your cart (linked list implementation)
delete items form cart (linked list delete implementation)
Price order from inc order or dec oreder (insertion sort)
Search for particular item (simple noob implementation, on you to add algorithm to it)
Exit as per your wish (press 0 to finish)
After that your summary is written on test file (you can see that on after opening it)
You can also add many other items to that project simply by adding them to listofitems txt file. 
which can be fetched to that project 
Hope you Enjoy:-)
Please appricate the Hard work
